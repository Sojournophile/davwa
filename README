*Running Dave's Vulnerable Webapp*

Do not run this exposed to the Internet. Do it in a lab behind NAT.

Use pip install -r requirements.txt to get Flask et. al.

Then create and activate a virtual environment. E.g.:

python -m venv venv           # Create a fresh venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Activate (Unix)
venv\Scripts\activate         # Activate (Windows)

This webapp has a private API at /internal-api/health.
It should only accept local connections.
By exploiting the public-facing app, we can view it.
